# Medium post response notifications

Apify actor to check for new responses to [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) posts. Enables the set up of notifications for any Medium members so you never miss posts from users or followers.
If [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-cz/) token and channel is provided, it sends a notification message for each new response by calling an existing [Slack Message Generator](https://apify.com/katerinahronik/slack-message) Actor. Equally, if an email address is provided, it sends a notification email for each new response by calling an existing [Send Mail](https://apify.com/apify/send-mail) Actor.
